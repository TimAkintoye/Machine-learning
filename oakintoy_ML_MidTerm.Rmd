# From the graph, we observe

#Less applications recieved, Less applications accepted, less number of students enrolled, less number of new students from top 25%
# Less number of new students from top 10%
# Less number of full time under graduate
# Out of station tution fee are less expensive
# Very few number of rooms
#Low cost of books
# Number of boards are low
# Graduation rate is low
# less percent of faculty ratio wrt phd

# Cluster 2 has
# Higher Graduation rate             
# High percentage faculty ratio w.r.t PHD   
# High in-state tutuion fee

#More number of full time graduates
#Huge amount of estimated book cost
#Huge amount of personal expenses
#Higher Student to faculty ratio
